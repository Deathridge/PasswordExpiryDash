# PasswordExpiryDash

Simple dashboard for displaying and searching users whose password has expired or will expire within 14 days.

By default the javascript looks in the same folder for expiry.json, you can change this in app.js

By default the powershell script needs an AD group set and an output path where to save the json file, you will also need to set these.

Tested as working in IE and Chrome, uses flexboxes so should be compatible across most browsers.

Mobile friendly!
